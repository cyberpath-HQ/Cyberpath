In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, accurate vulnerability assessment is not just important, it's critical.
Security teams, penetration testers, and analysts rely on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to quantify the
severity of security vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts. However, traditional CVSS calculators often
fall short in terms of user experience, accessibility, and modern features. That's where **Cyberpath Quant** comes in.

Today, we're excited to introduce Cyberpath Quant, a next-generation CVSS calculator that transforms vulnerability
severity assessment into an intuitive, efficient, and powerful experience. Whether you're a seasoned security
professional or just starting your journey in cybersecurity, Quant provides the tools you need to accurately assess
vulnerabilities with confidence.

## The Challenge with Traditional CVSS Calculators

If you've ever used a CVSS calculator, you know the pain points all too well. Traditional calculators often suffer from
clunky interfaces that make metric selection tedious and error-prone, especially when metric descriptions are buried
behind confusing labeling. Many calculators support only one or two CVSS versions, forcing security professionals to
juggle multiple tools when working with diverse vulnerability databases or legacy systems.

Mobile experiences are often an afterthought, delivering frustrating interfaces that don't adapt to smaller screens.
Export functionality is minimal or nonexistent, requiring analysts to manually copy scores and vectors into
documentation systems. There's no history tracking, so previous assessments are lost, forcing teams to re-assess similar
vulnerabilities from scratch. Perhaps most concerning, many traditional calculators process data server-side, raising
legitimate privacy questions about where your vulnerability data is stored and who has access to it.

These limitations slow down vulnerability assessment workflows and create friction in security operations. When every
second counts in identifying and remediating threats, your tools shouldn't be a bottleneck.

## Introducing Cyberpath Quant: Built for Modern Security Teams

Quant was designed from the ground up to address these challenges and deliver a CVSS calculator that security
professionals actually _want_ to use. Built by Ebalo with a focus on user experience, performance, and privacy, Quant
brings vulnerability assessment into the modern era.

### Universal CVSS Version Support

One of Quant's standout features is its comprehensive support for **all CVSS versions** in a single, unified interface.
Whether you're working with the latest CVSS v4.0 standard with its enhanced scoring methodology and supplemental
metrics, the industry-standard v3.1 that enjoys broad adoption across the security community, the original v3.0
specification, or even legacy v2.0 data from older vulnerability databases, Quant handles them all seamlessly.

Switch between versions using intuitive tabs, allowing you to compare scores across different CVSS standards or work
with legacy vulnerability data without ever leaving the tool. Need to check how a vulnerability scores under v4.0 versus
v3.1? Simply toggle between tabs and see both assessments side-by-side. This universal support ensures that no matter
which CVSS version your organization standardizes on, which vulnerability database you're referencing, or how diverse
your assessment needs are, Quant has you covered.

### Intelligent, Real-Time Scoring

Quant's scoring engine operates entirely in your browser using pure JavaScript, delivering **instant feedback** as you
adjust metrics. Watch your CVSS score update in real-time as you configure vulnerability parameters, with dynamic
color-coded severity indicators that instantly communicate risk levels.

This visual feedback system transforms abstract numbers into immediately understandable risk levels, helping security
teams quickly triage vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts without getting lost in numerical scores. The
color-coding works intuitively across different CVSS versions, ensuring consistent communication of risk regardless of
which scoring standard you're using.

### Advanced Metric Configuration

Understanding CVSS metrics is crucial for accurate vulnerability assessment. Quant makes this process intuitive by
providing interactive metric selection with clear, accessible controls for all metric groups. Rather than forcing you to
memorize metric meanings or hunt through documentation, Quant includes in-context help explaining each metric's meaning
and scoring implications directly in the interface.

The calculator provides full support for temporal and environmental metrics across all CVSS versions, and if you're
using CVSS v4.0, it includes supplemental metrics like Safety, Automatable, and Recovery. Each metric comes with
comprehensive documentation accessible directly from the calculator interface, complete with detailed explanations that
help you understand how each selection impacts the final score. This educational approach ensures you make informed
decisions when assessing vulnerabilities rather than blindly clicking through options.

## Powerful Features That Set Quant Apart

Beyond basic scoring capabilities, Quant includes advanced features that streamline vulnerability assessment workflows
and integrate seamlessly into your existing security operations.

### Score Management and Analytics

Quant's **Score Manager** transforms how you track and analyze vulnerability assessments. Save your assessments directly
in your browser for future reference, then organize them with powerful sorting and filtering by severity, date, CVSS
version, or custom tags. Need to compare two similar vulnerabilities to understand why they scored differently? The
side-by-side comparison feature shows you exactly where they differ. As new information about a vulnerability emerges,
you can edit and update previous assessments without losing the originals, and if needed, restore deleted assessments
from your complete history.

The Score Manager operates entirely client-side, ensuring your vulnerability data never leaves your browser while
providing enterprise-grade organizational capabilities. Think of it as a personal vulnerability research database that
travels with you, always available, always private.

### Visual Analytics and Charts

Transform raw CVSS data into actionable insights with Quant's built-in analytics engine. Generate severity distribution
charts showing how your organization's vulnerabilities spread across risk levels, helping you understand your overall
vulnerability landscape at a glance. Metric impact analysis visualizations show you which factors contribute most to
your scores, essential information when deciding whether to focus on remediating environmental factors or addressing core
vulnerabilities.

Compare scores across different CVSS versions to see how a vulnerability's severity assessment changes depending on
which scoring standard you apply. Interactive visualizations with customizable chart types and color schemes let you
tailor the output to your needs, and when it's time to report to stakeholders, simply export your charts as PNG images
for immediate inclusion in presentations and reports.

These visualization tools help security teams communicate vulnerability risk to stakeholders who may not be familiar
with technical CVSS metrics, making it easier to secure resources and buy-in for remediation efforts.

### One-Click Export and Sharing

Quant makes it effortless to document and share vulnerability assessments in whatever format your workflow requires.
Copy vector strings with a single click for quick documentation in tickets, reports, or vulnerability databases. When
you want colleagues to review your assessment or continue your work, generate shareable links with pre-configured
metrics that others can open and review or even edit further.

For teams building custom security dashboards or integrating vulnerability data into their websites, Quant generates
embeddable HTML code that brings interactive score cards directly into your applications. Need to move your assessment
history between devices or back up your work? Import and export your complete history as JSON. The URL-based vector
loading system is surprisingly powerful too, you can share exact assessments via simple links, making it easy to discuss
specific scores with team members or document decisions in issue trackers.

### Privacy-First Architecture

In an era of increasing privacy concerns and data breaches, Quant takes a **privacy-first approach** to vulnerability
assessment that sets it apart from traditional online calculators. All calculations happen in your browser using pure
JavaScript, with no server communication required. Your vulnerability assessments, whether they're from sensitive
penetration tests, internal security reviews, or confidential bug bounty research, never leave your computer or touch any
external servers.

You don't need to create an account, log in, or provide any personal information to use Quant. Start scoring immediately
without registration. We don't collect data about your usage, your assessments, or how you use the tool. The entire
source code is open source and available on GitHub, allowing security teams and auditors to verify our privacy
guarantees and scoring logic. This transparency means you're not trusting us on faith, you can verify for yourself that
we're doing exactly what we claim.
