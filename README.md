## Installation

Although CyberPath is an open-source project and you can install it and run it locally, we recommend using the
[official website](https://cyberpath-hq.com) for the best experience.

The website is updated automatically with every new release, and you can access the latest features, blog posts, and
project information without the need to install anything.

If you still want to run the platform locally, you can follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebalo55/cyberpath.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

   ```bash
   cd cyberpath
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies (pnpm is required):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start exploring the resources available in CyberPath. The platform is designed to be
user-friendly, allowing you to easily navigate through projects, blog posts, and career path information.

If you've chosen to deploy it locally, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

And access it at: [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

### Building for Production

To build the site for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will generate the static site and take screenshots for preview purposes.
